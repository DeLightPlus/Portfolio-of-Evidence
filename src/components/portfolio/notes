1. Personal Introduction
Hello! I'm Kabelo Peter Matlakala, a Junior Web Developer with a strong background in web development, UI/UX design, and mathematical sciences. My journey at CodeTribe Academy has been an exciting one, filled with learning and growth. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to apply my programming skills to various projects, gaining hands-on experience with technologies like React.js, Node.js, and Redux.

In my previous role as a Computer Laboratory Assistant at the University of Limpopo, I developed problem-solving and technical skills, while also assisting fellow students in the ICT lab. Through my academic background in Mathematical Science, I am also well-versed in algorithms, data structures, and the logic required to develop robust applications.

I am passionate about user-centered design and am eager to continue improving my development skills to create innovative, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
